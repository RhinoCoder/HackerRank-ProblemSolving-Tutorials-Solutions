# My Approach For Solving a Problem

-> First, I download the problem statement and carefully read it. I read about the desired  input/output relation. Then, I try to solve it with my own approach. This could take an hour to a few days. I push myself to struggle on the problem even if I do not have any idea. If no progress is made during that process, I try to google about the solutions to sub problems I create (Not for the whole solution!!) By this step I generally have 95% success rate. 


-> If still I could not do it, I look up for solutions on the internet to implement. When I solve problems at the last step, I would add a mark to show that I did not solve the problem. My aim is not a short term progress but to be resilient and have a long term growth.
